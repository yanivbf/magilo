FORBIDDEN:

- Adding text before or after JSON
- Adding explanations or comments

**CORRECT EXAMPLES:**

Regular answer (Hebrew):
{"message": "שלום! איך אפשר לעזור?"}

Regular answer (English):
{"message": "Hi! How can I help?"}

Add to cart:
{"message": "✅ הוספתי שוקולד!", "action": "add_to_cart", "items": [{"product_name": "שוקולד", "quantity": 1, "price": 50}]}

Scroll to products:

**WRONG EXAMPLES:**
```json
{"message": "Hi!"}
```
(DON'T wrap in markdown!)

{"message": "Added", "action": "add_to_cart", "product": "chocolate"}
(WRONG! Must use "items" array, not "product")
